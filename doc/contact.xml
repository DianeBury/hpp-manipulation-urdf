       In the first case, the contact surfaces are mobile and the following coordinates are
       expressed in the frame of the joint of "link_name". Use this to describe object contact
       surfaces.
       
       In the second case, the contact surfaces are static and the following coordinates are
       expressed in the frame of the object. As an object can be present in two links, a link
       name must be provided. If the link has only one object, the link name must still be
       provided.
